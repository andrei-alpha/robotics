1. Sonar measure distance
  22 cm min, 179 cm max
2. Sonar measure angle
  40 degrees maximum angular deviation
3. Sonar depth measurement
   30 cm - 31
   40 cm - 41
   60 cm - 61
   80 cm - 81
  On average we see an offset error of 1 cm.
4. 40 cm: 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41
   100cm: 101, 101, 101, 101, 101, 101, 101, 101, 101, 101

5. When very close only. Jan's fix helped us to remove spikes from the measurements.
